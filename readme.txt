These are a few demo tests I wrote for https://www.saucedemo.com/
They're simple and short, and I wrote them to practice a little with Selenium WD // Chromedriver
In the PDF you can find some information regarding each test, and the testcases written in gherkin syntax as well
The page object model present here is not a POM itself given I didn't import the UI elements from there, but works
as an example

To run these tests you need the latest Google Chrome version
You will need the latest version available of chromedriver (replace the one I put here with the one
you downloaded from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
The Pycharm project you chose to import the scripts needs to have Selenium installed (pip install -U selenium)
